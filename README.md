# Osu-Extractor
Extract song, images, and videos from installed Osu beatmaps 

Still work in progress. Will probably have a cli and gui interface (which you can choose from either of it).

# Disclaimer
I do not gain any money from this tool. I do not intend to support piracy of any kind. This tool is only made to help extracting song/img/videos from a beatmap. You should support the creators of each song/images/videos you extract. I recommend tools such as [saucenao](https://saucenao.com/) and [tineye](https://tineye.com/) to find the original image and author. You should also support the original music artist by buying their songs/albums.
